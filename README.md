# Trade, Commerce, and the Future

This is a shopping planner application. The main objective of this application is to reduce the shopping time by finding a store that carries the most items that the user is shopping for, along with showing where those items are located within the store. â€‹

Items can be added, removed, and are automatically categorized and saved. The application can download store layouts provided by the respective store. The users can view these layouts and find the store that contains the most amount of items that the user is shopping for, and where those items are located in the store. There are currently a few test layouts.
